Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python | Streamlit Web App - Deployment

•	In this project we have done multiple disease prediction by using three different datasets. These datasets contain all the records of the patient and through that information we predicted if the person has the particular disease or not.
•	Designed a website using Streamlit in python for better understanding and to be user friendly.
